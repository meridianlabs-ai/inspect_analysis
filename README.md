# inspect_analysis

## Installation


```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/meridianlabs-ai/inspect_analysis
```


## Development

We recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for development.
It will automatically manage virtual environments and dependencies for you.

Once you have created an environmen with uv, install for Python development as follows:

```sh
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

For JS / front-end development:

```sh
npm install
```

While developing, you can run the following in a separate terminal to automatically rebuild JavaScript as you make changes:

```sh
npm run dev
```
